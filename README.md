## Description of the app

SparkLine HR is a platform that has been created to service the company SparkLine Finance, and this platform will solve their problem of using paper-based documentation to track employee information such as their timesheets, payslips, and leave requests. It will solve the problem by providing a web application for HR to control employee data, and accept requests made by the user, along with creating performance reviews, releasing payslips, and posting training courses that have been completed. The employees will be able to view their own information such as payslips and performance reviews, as well as make timesheet/overtime submissions, and leave request submissions.

## Features

* Self-Service Portal: The Self-Service Portal will allow users to view their personal information, update contact and emergency contact details, view released payslips, and view pending overtime and leave requests.
* Timesheet Submission: This feature will allow users to submit their hours worked for specific weeks, and will send an overtime request to HR if the worked hours are over 40.
* Leave Request Submission: This feature will allow users to submit leave requests of different types, and will be forced to submit a doctor's note for sick leave.
* Development and Goals: Users can view training courses that have been completed and uploaded by hr, as well as performance reviews uploaded by them, and they can track their own personal goals in this feature.
* Incident and Feedback Reporting: This feature will allow users to report incidents to be viewed by HR on the web app, these incidents can either include the employee number, or be reported anonymously.

## Design Considerations

When designing the SparkLineHR app, several key considerations were made:

### User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
* Intuitive Navigation: The app features a simple and intuitive navigation structure to enhance user experience. Users can easily access payslip viewing, timesheet submission, and other features of the app.
* Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience on smartphones and tablets.

### Data Handling
* API Integration: The app integrates two APIs:
  * Custom Onboarding API: Handles user onboarding and login, and will send an email to first-time users with a one-time PIN to log into the app with before changing passwords
  * Custom Email API: This API will send users emails regarding Overtime Requests and Leave Requests that are declined or accepted by HR in order to notify them.
* Data Models: Defined data classes (e.g., Payslip, Timesheet, Leave Request) facilitate data management and ensure that the app correctly processes and displays information from Firebase.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
* Unit Testing: Unit tests are implemented to verify the functionality of critical features, such as Firebase database connections to ensure that data is written and read correctly.
* Automated Testing: Integration tests are executed on every push and pull request to ensure consistent performance and reliability of the app.
